This project is a simplified Binance Futures Testnet Trading Bot built using Python and Flask. It supports Market, Limit, and Stop-Limit order types through Binanceâ€™s Futures Testnet API and provides both a command-line interface and a basic web UI (using Flask) for interacting with the bot. The repository includes files like bot.py for handling trading logic, app.py for the web interface, main.py for CLI execution, a templates/ folder for HTML views, and .env support to securely store API keys and the base URL (https://testnet.binancefuture.com). The bot logs all trading activity in bot.log for traceability. To get started, you must create a .env file with your Binance Testnet API key, secret, and base URL, install dependencies (flask, python-binance, python-dotenv), and run app.py to use the browser interface or main.py for CLI mode. This project is intended for educational and demo purposes only and does not involve real funds.
